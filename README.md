# Grammar_builder
Program constructing a free grammar and a context sensitive grammar from Ð¢uring machine. Grammars generate a language of correct mathematical expressions for a multiplication in an unary number system.
____
To check if grammars generate a word, ***use*** `python main.py`.  
After that you can enter the word and if the grammars generate it, you will see an output of this word from the start nonterminal. If the word is not generated by the grammars, you will receive messages about it. Note that the output for free grammar contains the boundary characters (**#** and **$**) but you do not need to type them.  
You can continue checking or ***enter*** `:q` ***to stop the program***.
